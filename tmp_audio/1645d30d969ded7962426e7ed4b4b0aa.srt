Speaker 1: Part 2.

2
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:20,132
Speaker 0: You are going to listen to a talk about au pairs in the UK. First you have some time to look at questions 11 to 15. Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 15.

3
00:00:25,586 --> 00:01:20,799
Speaker 1: What is an au pair? An au pair is a single girl without any dependents who comes to the UK to learn English and to live as part of an English speaking family. She is not a domestic servant but may help in the house for up to 5 hours a day for pocket money. Suitable tasks would be lighthouse work and taking care of children. She should have one day each week completely free and she should be free to attend language classes and religious services if she wishes. Pocket money should be between £15 and £20 per week and she should have her own room. Before she arrives she should have as much information as possible about the home she is going to and what she will be expected to do. She will find it helpful to have a letter from her hostess explaining the arrangements to show the immigration officer when she arrives.

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:31,891
Speaker 0: Before you hear the rest of the talk you have some time to look at questions 16 to 20. Now listen and answer questions 16 to 20.

5
00:01:33,920 --> 00:03:28,119
Speaker 1: What is an au pair? An au pair must be a single girl aged at least 17 and no older than 27 when she first becomes an au pair. She must be a national of a Western European country which includes Malta, Cyprus and Turkey. The longest a girl may stay in the UK as an au pair is 2 years. A girl who has been in the UK before as an au pair will be allowed to come to the UK again as an au pair only if the total period is not more than 2 years. An au pair is not allowed to take a job in this country. The light household duties which are part of the au pair arrangement are not regarded as employment. An au pair who is a national of a country which is not in the Commonwealth or European Community, EC, and who is admitted for longer than 6 months will normally have to register with the police. This will be shown in her passport. She must take her passport and two passport size photographs to a police station. She will have to pay a fee, about £25. If an au pair wishes to stay longer than the time stamped in her passport, she may apply either by post to Luna House, Croydon or in person at one of the public inquiry offices. If she applies by post, it is a good idea to send any valuable documents by recorded delivery post. She should apply before the time limit on her permitted stay runs out. She must show that the arrangements are still those of an au pair. She may change host families during her time in the UK, providing that the new arrangements are also those of an au pair.

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,034
