The discussion refers to the rules and regulations of an au pair working in the UK. An au pair is described as a single, dependent-free female who has come to the UK to learn English while living with an English-speaking family. She's not a domestic servant but may do light housework and childcare for up to 5 hours daily in exchange for pocket money. She should have a free day weekly, be able to attend language classes, and have her own room. The au pair must be between 17 and 27, and a Western European national. She cannot be an au pair for over 2 years in total and she's not permitted to get a job. If she's from outside the Commonwealth or European Community and her stay exceeds 6 months, she should register with the police. If she wishes to extend her stay, she needs to apply before her permitted stay expires, and verify that she still qualifies as an au pair. She could change host families, provided the new arrangement also classifies as an au pair situation.
