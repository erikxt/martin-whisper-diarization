The text is a conversation between two instructors, Andrew and Sharon Zhou, about their upcoming course on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). They discuss three application uses of LLMs: the fast, easy-to-set-up prompting technique; the expensive and complex process of training large foundation models from scratch; and fine-tuning, a middle ground approach that is cost-efficient and delivers high performance for specific use cases. Fine-tuning allows users to adapt an open-source language model to their unique data, which can overcome the limitations of general-purpose LLMs. The course will teach how fine-tuning fits into training, how it differs from other approaches, and a specific variant called instruction fine-tuning. The goal is for students to come away with a practical understanding of fine-tuning LLMs for their own projects.
