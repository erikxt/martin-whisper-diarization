Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to learn without explicit programming. It is used widely in various applications like search engines, photo recognition software, and spam filters. One aspect of research in this field is teaching robots to perform tasks by observing and learning from human beings, with the end goal of building intelligent machines that can perform almost any task humans can do. Many scientists believe that such advancements can be achieved through learning algorithms called neural networks, which simulate the human brain's functionalities. The speaker invites listeners to learn more about this subject by implementing these concepts themselves.
