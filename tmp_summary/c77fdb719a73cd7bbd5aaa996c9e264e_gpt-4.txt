The new course, "Large Language Models with Semantic Search", developed in partnership with Cohere, aims to teach participants how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into the search capabilities of their applications. This is particularly beneficial for content-rich websites, enhancing search results by allowing users to pose questions instead of keyword search. The course will focus on the concepts of 'dense retrieval' and 're-ranking', using text embeddings to improve search relevance and response generation. Another key aspect is the construction of retrieval-augmented LLMs, which can retrieve factual information with more accuracy. Upon finishing the course, attendees will have a deeper understanding of LLMs' foundational principles and be inspired to use this technology creatively.
