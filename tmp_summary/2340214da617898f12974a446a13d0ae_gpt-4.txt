The upcoming fair, traditionally convened at the fairgrounds, has been relocated to City Park due to an ongoing high school construction project. Unlike previous years, the fair will commence on Friday evening, with a special dance performance featuring the city mayor. The cost of admission to the fair is maintained low, with a three-day pass going for $25, while a Saturday or Sunday pass will cost $15. The Friday opening event is free. The principal days of the fair, Saturday and Sunday, are packed with family-friendly events such as a clown show, concert by the lake, and a singing contest open to all at no cost. Additionally, there will be a diverse food court, children's games, and a craft sale area showcasing local artists.
